# TicTacToe using Kotlin
This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game made using Kotlin. If you're new to Kotlin this might help you get started.
The code has all the basics you need to learn if you want to dig deeper into kotlin. 
I have commented the AutoPlay code so that you can play the game with your friend. You can remove the comments if you want Autoplay i.e you'll be playing with the phone.
